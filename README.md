SQL  - Python - Tableau

Scenario:
You work as a Data Analyst for a real estate start-up (Pillow Palooza). 
The main objective of your job is to provide insight into the short-term rental market in New York City. 
In a competitive market, it is your goal to help the start-up identify opportunities for growth and success.
To accomplish this, the Head of Data has requested that you build a project that collects Airbnb listing data from multiple sources, cleans it, and analyzes it. 
The analysis will aim to uncover key trends in popular neighborhoods, rental prices, property types, length of stay, and demand over time.

The insights gained from the analysis had the potential to provide valuable information to the start-up on how to make informed business decisions. 
For example, Pillow Palooza could use the insights to identify which neighborhoods to invest in, which property types to focus on, and how to price their rentals to remain competitive in the market.

By providing these insights, the project aimed to help Pillow Palooza make strategic decisions that could lead to growth and success in the short-term rental market in New York City.

After meeting with your team, you wrote some questions to guide you along the analysis:

What are the most popular neighborhoods for short-term rentals in New York City?

What is the average rental price for short-term rentals in New York City, and how does it vary by neighborhood and property type?

What are the most commonly rented property types on Airbnb in New York City, and how does this vary by neighborhood?

What is the average length of stay for short-term rentals in New York City, and how does this vary by neighborhood and property type?

How has demand for short-term rentals in New York City changed over time, and are there any seasonal trends that could impact business decisions?
